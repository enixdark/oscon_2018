# [Main](../#tutorial-exercises) => Generate a histogram from Istio latency data

#### We just took a look at what histograms are and what we can do with them when we have latency data from a web service. Let's take the request data from the sample adapter we created, extract it, and display it as a histogram distribution using the R statistical language.

#### If you don't have R installed, pair up with someone who does, or use one of the third party adapters that supports distribution based analysis. This repository contains a sample distribution of data that you can use if you weren't able to extract latency telemetry from a Mixer adapter.

# generate the histogram, use 100 bins, set x axis 1-100
> hist(myData$latency,main="Istio request latency",xlab="milliseconds",border="blue",col="green",xlim=c(1,100),breaks=100)


# calculate the average
> mean(myData$latency)
[1] 29.79565


# calculate the median
> median(myData$latency)
[1] 9


# calculate the 90th percentile
> quantile(myData$latency, c(0.9))
90%
 72


# calculate the 99th percentile
> quantile(myData$latency, c(0.99))
   99%
107.15
