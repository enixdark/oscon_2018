# [Main](../#tutorial-exercises) => Setup Istio

#### In this exercise we will setup the Istio service mesh on either a Kubernetes environment, or one with Docker and Consul. If you don't have the facilities to do either of those, fear not. Google Kubernetes Engine.

#### We'll follow the Istio docs; there are a number of additional installation options that you might want to try out too. Thirty minutes is a good goal for this exercise; don't sweat it if it takes you longer, this isn't a race.
